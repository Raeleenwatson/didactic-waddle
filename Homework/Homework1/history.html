               <p>Computer programming has been around for a long time. The technology and efficeny has just gotten better. The first computer program was made in 1843 by a mathematician, Ada Lovelace, who published an algorithm. </p>
               <p>Computer programming is a process that leads from an original formulation of a computing problem to executable computer programs. </p>
               <p>What started off as a couple programming languages has now turned into hundreds. There are C++, Java, Javascript, PHP, MySQL, C, CSS, Python, and many more. </p>
               <p>Programming is set to be around for a long time with a lot more advancements and changes to it.</p>
