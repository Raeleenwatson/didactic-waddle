               <p> <span>&#8594;</span> There are plenty of ways to learn programming if one is interested. There are free online classes offered to anyone who wants to learn.</p>
               <p><span>&#8594;</span> There is Codeacademy, Udacity, Khan Academy, and a lot more. Learning a language online can be extremly useful, especially if the person is a slower learner. It goes at the users pace and they are able to go back if they need to.</p>
               <p><span>&#8594;</span> Any for of higher education is a good way to understand how and why everything works. The Computer Science courses will all go over how and why everything works. The courses will go over a lot of different programming languages in depth.</p>
               <p><span>&#8594;</span> However, any way of learning is great. Whether it be online, at a trade school, or at an university.</p>
