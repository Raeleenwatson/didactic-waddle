                <p>With technology advancing there are many different things to do with programming languages.</p>
                <p>Anyone with the knowledge of how to program can create almost anything they want. </p>
                <p>Programming isn't just used on personal computers to create programs. Programming can also be used to program robots, arduinos, create android apps, etc. </p>
                <p>Depending what someone is trying to accomplish, they would use whatever language fit the program best.</p>
                <p>For example, if someone wanted to create an android app they would use Java simply because it has a lot of framwork features. It's best to be familiar with multiple languages so that the project can be executed best. </p>
